# Cryptocurrency

This theme of this application is based around the topic cryptocurrency. The intent of the application is to provide an area for learning of cryptocurrency, where cryptocurrencies and their information are displayed by card and recycler view.
The second portion of this application is a notes section where a user can write notes on cryptocurrency as they go. Notes can be added, updated, deleted and searched using the applicable buttons and search bar.

While the structure is present for the learning session, the code for displaying the pages was commented out to get the notes section working as there was overlapping stopping the app from launching.

Originally, cryptocurrency market data tracking was intended for the application using the CoinMarketCap API. However, the API structure and functionality changed during the semester and a decision was made to add notes functionality instead to save time.
